### Design of FluidTac

FluidTac transforms water flow disturbances into high-dimensional, dynamic features via a circularly arranged set of passive propellers. The system utilizes an internal camera to extract passive propeller rotation features and employs a neural network to establish a nonlinear mapping between hydrodynamic responses and the body's forward velocity.
